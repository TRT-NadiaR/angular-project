      <h4>About us</h4>
      <p class="bold_p">
        Tiddlywinks Day Nursery was founded in 1994 by husband & wife David and Imelda Mihell. The vision started at our Hill Lane nursery in the same year following the conversion of a previous farmhouse where the family had lived. Imelda oversaw the day to day running of the nursery as manager creating a nursery full of character and charm which the children and families viewed as a home from home. Tiddlywinks soon became a family run business after sons Ashley and Ben joined in 2007, after years of guidance from their parents alongside completing their studies at university. </p> 
        <p>Our company ethos is to offer families a high quality, flexible, child centred service where parents can be confident in the care and education their child will receive with us. We aim to make each childâ€™s time with us a happy, fun filled and exciting journey in which we work in close partnership with parents and carers sharing each milestone.</p>
